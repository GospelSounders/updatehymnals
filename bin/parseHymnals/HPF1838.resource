A good selection of Hymns is still much wanted.
The present selection is not regarded by the compiler as any thing more than a temporary expedient.
It is, however believed, that in a very little time, one really suited to the exigencies of the Church of God will appear.

His is love, ’tis love unbounded,
Without measure, without end;
Human thought is here confounded;
’Tis too vast to comprehend:
Praise the Saviour!
Magnify the sinners’ friend.
While we tell the wondrous story
Of the Saviour’s cross and shame,
Sing we—“ Everlasting glory
Be to God and to the Lamb.”
Saints and angels,
Give ye glory to His name.

1 W e ’ ll sing of the Shepherd that died,
That died for the sake of the flock;
His love to the utmost was tried,
But firmly endur’d as a rock.
2 When blood from a victim must flow,
This Shepherd, by pity, was led
To stand between us and the foe,
And willingly died in our stead.
3 Our song then for ever shall be,
Of the Shepherd who gave Himself thus;
No subject’s so glorious as He,
No them e’s so afFecting to us.
4 We ’ll sing of such subjects alone,
None other our tongues shall employ;
Till better His love becomes known,
In yonder bright regions of joy.
III.— 7, 7, 8, 7. bis.
1
H ead of the church triumphant!
We joyfully adore Thee,
’Till Thou appear
Thy members here
3
Would sing like those in glory!
We lift our hearts and voices,
In blest anticipation,
And cry aloud,
And give to God
The praise of our salvation.
2 While in affliction’s furnace,
And passing through the fire;
The love we praise
Which tries our ways,
And ever brings us nigher;
We clap our hands, exulting,
In Thine almighty favour,
The love divine
Which made us Thine,
Shall keep us Thine for ever.
3 Thou dost conduct Thy people,
Through torrents of tem ptation;
Nor will we fear,
While Thou art near
The fire of tribulation:
The World, with Sin and Satan,
In vain our march opposes ;
By Thee we shall
Break through them all,
And sing the song of Moses.4
4 By faith we see the glory
Of which Thou dost assure us,
The world despise
For that high prize
Which Thou hast set before u s ;
And if Thou count us worthy,
We each would die like Stephen,
And see Thee stand
At God’s right hand,
To take us up to heaven.

Once for favor’d sinners slain!

Swell the triumph of His train!

See in solemn pomp appear!

Rise to meet Him in the air.

Full of grace and majesty,
Tho’ they set at nought and sold Him,

Take Thy waiting people home.

Nearer still, thro’ Jesus’ blood;

And, in songs of rich salvation,
Shout to Abba endless praise.

And Thine, the sons of men.

One when in heav’n He took His seat,

The captive Surety now is freed,
And Death, our foe, disarm’d.

1 As saints we will not be dismay*d,
Nor sink in hopeless fear;
For as we ever need His aid,
The Saviour ’s ever near.
2 Thus has He met our desp’rate case,
And giv’n us lasting joy and peace;
The Lamb, Whose life can never end,
At once our Sacrifice and Friend 1 2 This Abr’ham found: he rais’d the knife—
God saw, and said, “ Forbear 1
Yon ram shall yield its meaner life,
Behold the victim there.”
3 Great Advocate, Almighty Friend,
On Thee do all our hopes depend:
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Thou dost plead, and must prevail. 3 Once David seemed Saul’s certain prey;
But hark! the foe’s at hand;
Saul turns his arms another way,
To save th’ invaded land.
4 In ev’ry dark distressing hour,
When Sin and Satan join their pow’r,
Let this bless’d truth repel each dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart. 4 When Jonah sunk beneath the wave,
He thought to rise no more;
But God prepar’d a fish to save,
And bear him to the shore.
5 Away, then, sad and doubtful thoughts!
Above our fears, above our faults,
His pow’rful intercessions rise,—
And we o’ercome while Satan flies. 5 Since proofs so plain of pow’r and grace,
Are taught us in His word;
To Fear or Care we ’ll not give place,
But wait upon the Lord.42

And, though it tarry, w ait:
The promise may be long delayed,
But cannot come too late.

To make us His alone;

And Faith replies, “ Enough!”

Of ills that we have done!

Let us obey the call;
Assur’d whate ’er the flesh may feel,
His love deserves our all. 2 Sin, Satan, Death appear
To harass and appal;—
Yet since the gracious Lord is near,
Backward they go and fall.
3 Then let us keep in view
His glory, as our end;
Too much we cannot bear, or do,
For such a gracious Friend. 3 Before, behind, around,
They set their fierce array,
To fight and force us from our ground,
Along life’s narrow way.
4 And let us stand prepar’d
In duty’s path to ru n ;
Nor count the greatest trials hard,
So that His will be done. 4 We meet them face to face,
Through Jesus’ conquest blest;
March in the triumph of His grace,
Right onward to our rest.45

Trod all our foes beneath His feet,
By being trodden down.
3 He Hell in hell laid low;
Made sin, He Sin o’erthrew;
Bow’d to the grave, destroy’d it so,
And Death, by dying slew.

And put your armour on—
Strong in the strength which God supplies
Through His eternal Son.
2 Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His mighty pow’r—
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts,
Is more than conqueror.
3 Stand in His heav’nly might,
With all His strength endu’d,
But take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God.76

And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o’ercome, through Christ alone,
And stand complete at last.

My comrades thro’ the wilderness,
Who still your sorrows feel;
Awhile forget your griefs and fears,
And look beyond this vale of tears,
To that celestial hill.
2 Look forward to that happy place,
Beyond the bounds of time and space,
The Saints’ secure abode;
On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise,
And force your passage to the skies,
And scale the mount of God.
3 See where the Lamb in glory stands,
Encircled by His radiant bands,
And join the angelic pow’rs;
For all that height of glorious bliss
Our everlasting portion is,
And all that heav’n is ours.

4 Who suffer with their Master here,
Shall soon before His face appear,
And at His side sit down;
To patient faith the prize is sure,
And all who to the end endure
The cross, shall wear the crown.

It lifts the fainting spirit up,
It brings to life the dead;
Our conflicts here shall soon be past,
And we shall all ascend at last,
Triumphant with our Head.

Midst flaming worlds, in these array’d
With joy shall we lift up the head.
2 Bold shall we stand in that great day,
For who aught to our charge shall lay,
While by Thy blood absolv’d we are
From sin’s tremendous curse and fear?
3 Thus Abraham, the friend of God,
Thus all the saints redeem’d with blood,78
Saviour of sinners Thee proclaim
And all their boast is in Thy name.
4 This spotless robe the same appears,
When ruin’d nature sinks in years,
No age can change its glorious hue,
The robe of Christ is ever new.

And bid Thy chosen ones rejoice,
Their beauty this, their glorious dress,
Jesus, the Lord our righteousness.

For He has felt the same.

The great Redeemer stood,
While Satan’s fiery darts He bore,
And did resist to blood.

Pour’d out His cries and tears
And in His measure feels afresh
What ev’ry member bears.

Leading the exil’d people hom e!82

A thousand glories more
Than the rich gems and polish’d gold,
The sons of Aaron wore.
2 They, first, their own sin-offering brought,
To purge themselves from sin ;
Thy life was pure without a spot,
And all Thy nature clean.
3 Fresh blood, as constant as the day,
Was on their altars spilt;
But Thy one offering took away
For ever all our guilt.
4 Thoji, great Melchizedec! shalt reign,
In peace, on Zion’s hill,
(Thyself the Lamb that once was slain),
And bear Thy priesthood still.
5 Till then for us to intercede
Before the Father’s face,

To the joy the Gospel brings ?
Well may we resign its pleasures,
Jesus brings us better things;
All His people
Draw from heav’n’s eternal springs.
3 Fly, ye seasons, fly still faster,
Swiftly bring the glorious day;

Come from heav’n without delay,
Take Thy people,
Take, O take them hence away.

Go forth with joy to meet H im ;

Where, free from all restraint and fear,
They feast on joys but tasted here.

To take our place upon His throne,
And know, as we ourselves are known.

When, their theme of praise the same,
They exalt Jehovah’s name !

Such as did the Father move:
He beheld the world undone;
Lov’d the world, and gave His Son.
3 Sing the Son’s unbounded love;
How He left the realms above;
To rejoin the Father’s side
With a blood-bought spotless Bride.
4 In the love too, make your boast,
That vouchsaf’d the Holy Ghost,
He has chas’d the mists away,
Turn’d our night to glorious day.

There to raise a sweeter strain,
Of redeeming love again.

In folly’s paths, nor seek our rest
Where Jesus had no home.

In spirit dwell above.

They ’ll feel no want, and fear no ill,
Nor sin nor sorrow any more. 1 A nd art Thou, gracious Master, gone,

And we shall dwell with Him above;
Yea, we shall see Him as He is,
The Lord of grace, of truth, and love.

The judgment of the martyr’d Lamb ?

And keep th’ eternal jubilee ?

A mansion to prepare for me ?
Shall I behold Thee on Thy throne,
And there for ever sit with Thee ?
Then let the world approve or blame,
I’ll triumph in Thy glorious name.
2 Should I, to gain the world’s applause,
Or to escape its harmless frown,
Refuse to countenance Thy cause,
And make Thy people’s lot mine own,
W hat shame would fill me in that day
When Thou Thy glory shalt display!
3 N o ; let the world cast out my name,
And vile account me, if they w ill;155
If to confess my Lord be shame,
I purpose to be viler still;
For Thee, my God, I’d all resign,
Content that I can call Thee mine.

For ah ! what joy will fill my heart,
When Thou my worthless name shalt own,
When I shall see Thee as Thou art,
And know as I myself am known:
When I, from sin and sorrow free,
Shall like my Lord for ever be.

Quick, from the dead awake!
Unto salvation wise,
Oil in your vessels ta k e ;
Awake 1 and hear the midnight cry,
“ Behold the heav’nly Bridegroom nigh.”

The nations to His bar,
And raise to glory all
Who call’d to glory a re ;
Make ready for your full reward,
And go with joy to meet your Lord.

Your everlasting Friend; —
Your Head to glorify,
With all His saints,—ascend;

And sing for ever of His grace.

(Let it to all be known),
That we shall be caught up
To share the Saviour’s throne,
Call’d to partake the marriage feast,
Though of all saints the very least.

The trumpet’s welcome sound;
That when the Lord appear,
Watching may we be found!
Cloth’d in the righteousness divine,
In which His Bride shall ever shine.

And nerves the feeble arm for fight;
It takes its terror from the grave,
And gilds the bed of death with light.

The sinners’ refuge here below,
The angels’ theme in heav’n above.

Apostate sinners to retrieve
From nature’s deadly fall;
As Thou hast bought us with a price,
Our sins against us ne’er can rise,
For Thou hast borne them all.

Him Who without the city bled
To expiate our stain ;
Who, God of God, vouchsaf’d to dwell
In flesh, to make of full avail
The sufFrings of the man.
3 See Him for our transgressions giv’n,
See the incarnate God of heav’n,
For us, His foes, expire;
Rejoice! rejoice! the tidings hear !
He bore, that we might never bear,
His Father’s righteous ire.
4 Ye saints, “ the Man of sorrows” bless,
The Lord, for your unrighteousness
Deputed to atone;
Praise, till with all the ransom’d throng
Ye sing the never-ending song,
And sit upon His throne !

That leads us to the saints’ abode;

In hope we find a sweet relief;

For hope anticipates the day,
When all our grief shall pass away.

Or all we can endure below,
To that bright day when Christ shall come
And take His weary pilgrims home ?

The thorny road, and never faint;
Though now by weariness opprest,
The end is everlasting rest.

By all Thy pain and grief;
Then hear us, Great Preserver,
And worship now receive.

Accursed on the tree. 1 W e give Thee thanks unfeigned,

For what Thy soul sustained,
When Thou for us didst bleed;
Grant us to lean unshaken
Upon Thy faithfulness;
Until to glory taken,

Faith sees Him always near,—
A guide, a glory, a defence,
To save from ev’ry fear.

So surely those that trust His name

And men that see its brightness there,

5 Of truth the pillar and the ground,
May we continue all our days;
In love and discipline be found,
As truly witnessing His praise.
1 H e bids us come; His voice we know,
And boldly on the waters go,
To Him our God and Lord;
We walk on life’s tempestuous sea,
For He Who died to set us free
Hath call’d us with His word
2 Secure, on boist’rous waves we tread,
Nor all the billows round us dread,
While to the Lord we look;
The Tempter drives his vortex round;
We pass it as on solid ground;
The wave is firm as rock.166
3 But if from Him we turn the eye,
We see the raging floods run high,
We feel our fears w ithin;
Our foes so strong, our flesh so frail,
Reason and unbelief prevail,
And plunge us into sin.
4 Lord! we our unbelief confess,
Do Thou our little faith increase,
That we may doubt no m ore;
But fix on Thee a steady eye,
And on Thine outstretch’d arm rely,
Till all the storm is o’er.

Welcome to the saints alone,

1 F rom far we see the glorious day,
When He Who bore our sins away,
Will all His majesty display.
2 “ A Man of Sorrows” once He was,
No friend was found to plead His cause,
For all preferr’d the world’s applause.168
3 He groan’d beneath sin’s awful load,
For in the sinner’s place He stood,
And died to bring us back to God.
4 But now He sits with glory crown’d,
While angel hosts the throne surround,
And still His lofty praises sound.
5 To few on earth His name is dear;
And they who in His cause appear,
The world’s reproach and scorn must bear.
6 Yet soon there is a day to come,
When He will seal the scorner’s doom,
And take His mourning people home.
7 Jesus, Thy name is all our boast;
And though by waves of trouble tost,
Thou wilt not let Thine own be lost.
169
Legions of foes beset Thee round,
But all were put to shame.
2 Avict’ry, glorious and complete,
Thou by Thy death didst gain;
So in Thy cause would we contend,
And all for Thee sustain.
3 While onward to the conflict led,
No sorrow would we fear,
Prepar’d our ransom’d lives to shed,
Nor count them to us dear.
4 W e ’d trace the footsteps Thou hast trod
To glory and renown;
Sustain Thy combat and Thy cross,
As call’d to share Thy crown.

That calls you from on high,170-171
’Tis His own hand presents the prize—
The crown of victory.

Lord! help us still to follow Thee,
Patient, the race to run,
Till crown’d with vict’ry round Thy Throne,

1 T he promise is fulfill’d,
Salvation’s work is done;
Justice and Mercy reconcil’d,
For God has rais’d His Son.
2 He left death’s sad abode,
From all corruption free ;
The holy, harmless, Son of God
Could no corruption see.
3 In Him the saints are ris’n,
From guilt and judgment clear,
And now upon the throne of heav’n,
In Him their Head appear.

When Jesus reviv’d from the grave!

To banish for ever our fears,
To triumph, almighty to save.
How strong were His tears and His cries 1
The worth of His blood how divine 1
How perfect His one sacrifice,
Who rose, though He suffer’d for sin !
2 The Man, Whose mock-crown was of thorn,
Whom sinners agreed to deride,
The M an, Who bore scourging and scorn,
The Man, Who on Calvary died,
Now blessed for ever is made,
And life has rewarded His pain;
Now glory encircles His head,
Heav’n sings of the Lamb that was slain.
3 And lo ! when He cometh again,
His foes shall be clothed with shame;
But gladness the saints shall obtain,
And glory, and peace, with the Lamb.
Then let us look forward to this,
And joyfully take up His cross:
As saints we shall be where He is,
And all that we lose is but dross.172 173
CLXXII.—6, 6, 6, 6, 8, 8. Gladly we own His title, then,
And at His feet in worship bend.

Who there in glory stands ?
What title doth He bring,
That worship He demands ?
Jehovah’s name, in battle strong,
Alone can be the Church’s song.
2 The pow’rs of hell oppos’d,
When He in conflict bled;
And death’s strong bars were clos’d
Round His expiring head: —
But death and hell possess’d no pow’r,
To hold Him past th’ appointed hour.
3 ’Twas for the church He bled,
’Twas for the Church He rose,
That she in Him, her Head,
Might overcome all foes: —
Jehovah Jesus is His name,
And all His deeds His worth proclaim.
4 Himself the Son of God,
The Lord, from conquest come;
He shed His precious blood,
That we might share His home.

The lamp of her salvation bum
With everlasting light.
3 The Gentiles shall her glory view,
And kings declare her fame,
And hers shall be a title new,
Which Israel’s God shall name.
4 The Lord shall hold her with His hand,
And wear her for His own,
His diadem her beauteous land,
Her royalty His crown.

Who trust the Saviour’s grace
Shall see His face at last;
The clouds that now obstruct their sight,
Shall quickly all be put to flight.

Salvation draweth nigh;
See where the morning spreads
Its radiance through the sky;

The Lord Himself will soon appear.
3 Though men your Hope deride
(Nor will e’en God believe),
Do you in Him confide,
Whose word can ne’er deceive;
When heav’n and earth shall pass away,
The saints shall see a glorious day.

A bright abode on high,

1 T he day of glory bearing
Its brightness far and near,

For us on Calv’ry bled ;
Jehovah did afflict Him,
And bruis’d Him in our stead.
3 But now H e’s interceding
For us who on Him r e s t;
And grace from Him proceeding,
Tells us in Him we ’re blest.

Who comes His saints to raise,
To perfect all the story
Of wonder, love, and praise.

Thus upon the Lamb to rest,
And to know in God’s salvation,
How the saints are fully blest.

While upon the Lamb we gaze,
See our trespasses forgiven,
And our songs of triumph raise.

Safe into the promis’d re st;
Choose the p a t h t h e way whatever

Watch and keep us night and day,
Else our foolish hearts will wander
From the straight and narrow way.
4 O h ! that strong in faith abiding,
We may to the Saviour cleave,
Nought with Him our hearts dividing,
All for Him content to leave. 2 Since in Thee we found redemption,
And Salvation full and free,
Nothing can our souls dishearten
But forgetfulness of Thee;
Nought can stay our steady progress,
More than conq’rors we shall be,
If our eye, whate’er the danger,
Looks to Thee, and none but Thee.
5 May we still, God’s mind discerning,
To the Lamb for wisdom go;
There new wonders daily learning,
All the Father’s glory know. 3 In Thy presence we are happy;
In Thy presence we ’re secure;
In Thy presence all afflictions
We can easily endure;178-179
In Thy presence we can conquer,
We Can suffer, we can d ie;
Wand’ring from Thee we are feeble;
Let Thy love, then, keep us nigh.

All the vain things that charm’d me most,

He trod the fierce Avenger down ;
There, power itself and weakness meet,
Emblems of each yon thorny crown !

That were an off’ring far too small;
Love so amazing, so divine,
Demands my soul, my life, my all.

And all the form of love He wears,
Exalted on the throne;187

Grace to pardon ev’ry sin ;

Chosen, call’d, and reconcil’d ;
Once a rebel full of taint,
Now a duteous, humble saint.

Cease toward the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be,
Yet will He remember me. 2 Happy Christian, look on high,
See thy portion in the sky;
Fix’d by everlasting love,
Who that portion can remove ?
3 His is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above,
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death. 3 Happy Christian, though the earth
Cannot know thy gracious worth,
Yet thy God shall soon proclaim,
Through all heav’n, thy favour’d name.
4 I shall see His glory soon,
When the work of grace is done, 4 Happy C hristian, angels say,
“ Turn thy heart from earth away,

Leave the world and all its woes,
Take with Christ thy sweet repose.”

Rise, the kingdom now is nigh!
When thou shalt, upon His throne,
See what Christ has made thine own.

Our souls shall for ever delight,
And join with the blessed above
In praises by day and by night.
Wherever we follow Thee, Lord,
Admiring, adoring, we see
That love which was stronger than death,
Flow out without limit, and free.
2 Descending from glory on high,
W ith men Thy delight was to dwell,
Contented, our surety to die,
By dying to save us from hell;
Enduring the grief and the shame,
And bearing our sin on the cross,
Oh 1 who would not boast of this love,
And count the world’s glory but loss ?

Our ev’ry wish contains;
With this, beneath temptation’s load,
The heart no more complains.

Gild each dark scene with light;
This is the sunshine of the soul:
Without it all is night.
3 0 happy scenes of pure delight,
Where Love’s full beams impart
Unclouded beauty to the sight,
And gladness to the heart.
4 Our place in those fair realms of bliss,
Our spirits long to know;
Our wishes terminate in this,
Nor can they rest below.
5 Nor do these wishes of the heart
Seem foolish, Lord, to Thee;
For thou hast said, that where Thou art,
There we shall ever be.195
6 Thus can our cheerful spirits sing
The darkest hour away,
And rise on faith’s expanded wing,
To everlasting day.
196
Thy hand our foes subduing,
And drying all our tears,—
Our hearts with rapture burning,
The path we shall retrace,
Where now our souls are learning
The riches of Thy grace.

We only look to Thee;
’Tis in Thy love and favour
Our souls find liberty.
While Satan fiercely rages,
And shipwreck oft we fear,—
'Tis this our grief assuages
That Thou art always near.
2 Yes, tho’ the tempest round us
Seems safety to defy;
Tho’ rocks and shoals surround us,
And swell the billows high—
Thou dost from death protect us,
And cheer us by Thy love;
Thy counsels too direct us
Safe to the Rest above.
3 There—with what joy reviewing
Past conflicts, dangers, fears,
4 0 then how loud the chorus
Shall to Thy name resound,
From all at rest before us,
From all Thy grace hath found 1
One joyful song for ever
Each harp, each lip shall raise,
The praise of our Redeemer,
Our God and Saviour’s praise.
CXCVI.— 7 ,6 .

Wilt Thou remain away?
Our hearts are growing weary
Of Thy so long delay;
0 when shall come the moment,
When, brighter far than morn,
The sunshine of Thy glory
Shall on Thy people dawn ?196
2 How long, 0 gracious Master,
Wilt Thou Thy household leave?
So long hast Thou now tarried,
Few Thy return believe:
Immers’d in sloth and folly,
Thy servants, Lord, we see;
And few of us stand ready
With joy to welcome Thee.
3 How long, 0 Heav’nly Bridegroom,
How long wilt Thou delay 1
And yet how few are grieving,
That Thou dost absent stay:
Thy very Bride her portion
And calling hath forgot,
And seeks for ease and glory
Where Thou, her Lord, art not.
4 0 wake Thy slumbering virgins;
Send forth the solemn cry,
Let all Thy saints repeat it,
“ The Bridegroom draweth nighl”
May all our lamps be burning,
Our loins well girded be,
Each longing heart preparing
With joy Thy face to see.

1 O nce we all were wretched strangers,
All the enemies of G od;
Heedless of our sins and dangers,
On the brink of death we stood,
Nought deserving
But of wrath the fiery flood.
2 Now our blinded eyes are waking,
And our misery we see;
Now our stony hearts are breaking;
From eternal wrath we flee
• To the refuge,
Open’d, Lamb of God, in Thee.
3 ’Twas Thy Love, 0 God, that knew us
Earth’s foundation long before:
That same love to Jesus drew us
By its sweet constraining pow’r,
And will keep us
Safely now, and evermore.
4 God of love, our souls adore Thee!
We would still Thy grace proclaim,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
And in glory praise Thy nam e;
Hallelujah!
Be to God and to the Lamb.198

Nor earth nor hell can move;
Our daily boast and song is this—
Jesus is ours, and we are His.

“ No man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth
and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church.” Eph.
v. 28, 29.
W hen first, in purpose deep,
The Church was brought to view,
In God’s eternal mind,—
(Though none His counsel knew),
The Father gave her to the Son,
And He betroth’d her for His own.
2 And though in Adam’s loins
She brake His holy word;
And, treach’rously untrue,
Departed from her Lord:
He brought her back, though hell withstood,
Wash’d from her sins in His own blood.
3 Part of that church are we,—
Whom He did thus redeem,
Learning by daily proof
Our daily need of H im ;
Taught by the Spirit to confess
Jesus our only righteousness.
4 Yea, more,—to crown the whole
(His gracious plan to prove),
5 Yes! we are one with Him
’Mid all our lep’rous state;
And who was ever yet
Fain his own flesh to hate ?
" One spirit with the Lord! ” this proves—
In loving us Himself He loves.
6 Nor can He cease to love;
For His own precept is,
“ Ye husbands love your wives,”—
And will not Christ love His ?
Will not He cherish and refresh
Bone of His bone, flesh of His flesh ?
1
Ah, yes! Christ loves the church
’Tis her He lives to bless ;
He cannot love her more,
Nor will He love her less:
Fair in His sight, cleans’d by the word,
A bride adorn’d, meet for her Lord.1 9 9 -2 0 0

None beside need we to fear,
Us to Jesus He hath giv’n,
Sons of God, and heirs of Heav’n. ,

Strong in His full strength we stand,
None can pluck us from His hand.

To the end we shall endure,
In His service onward go,
Till we conquer ev’ry foe.

Only now would seek Thy praise.

Bear with joy Thy cross and shame;
Only seek to follow Thee,
Though reproach our portion be.203—2 0 4

The great Redeemer’s praise!
The glories of the living God,
Reveal’d in Jesu’s face.

From Hell to set us free;
That gave the Lamb, whose precious blood
Has seal’d our liberty.

And find eternal peace;
We meet our God in Jesus Christ,
And fear and terror cease.

When Jehovah’s work begun,
When He spake, and it was done.
2 This precious truth His word reveals;
And all His mercies prove—•
Creation and redemption join
To shew—that God is love. 2 Songs of praise awoke the morn,
When the Prince of Peace was born;
Songs of praise arose, when He
Captive led captivity.
3 His patience, bearing much and long,
With those who from Him rove,
His kindness when He leads them home,
Both mark—that God is love. 3 Heav’n and earth must pass away,
Songs of praise shall crown the day:
God will make new heav’ns and earth,
Songs of praise shall hail their birth.

By pow’r from heav’n above;
And ev’ry step, from first to last,
Declares—that God is love. 4 And must man alone be dumb,
Till that glorious kingdom come ?

His name is all my tr u s t;
He will not put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.
3 Firm as His life His promise stands,
And He can well secure
W hat I’ve committed to His hands,
’Till the appointed hour.

Before the Father’s face,
And in the new Jerusalem
Give to my soul its place.

2 All the worldling’s mirth is madness,
All his labour fruitless toil;
’Tis the saints that taste of gladness,
Tho’ the world their choice revile:
Sweet their portion,
Life is in the Saviour’s smile.

Then the world our hearts possest;

Since the Lord has made us blest:

To sing of Christ, the Lord we own ;

So various as the love of God ?
Is any other name so great,
As His Who bore our heavy load ?

That makes his opposition cease,
Beholding love’s amazing plan,

But He, Whose mercy freely flows
Has sav’d us from eternal death.

And us in all that glory bring
His own peculiar throne to share.

And, through the world her glory known,

For Gentile hosts in Judah’s land
Shall swell her praise and join her pray’r

(God’s redeeming love adore !)
Jesus stands in heav’n a Saviour,
Full of mercy join’d with pow’r ;
He is able,
He is willing evermore.
3 Conscience could not make us linger,
Nor of fitness could we dream ;
All the fitness He requireth,
Is that we have need of Him :
Jesus gave us
Free salvation in His name.

How great the depth, how high it flows,
No saint can tell, no angel knows.

With vials full of odours sweet,
And harps of sweeter sound. 3 But though resisted long, He strove;

And though provok’d, forgave.239—240

With Jesus’ blood He sav’d and bought,
And freed her from her sin.

To choose and to command,
W ith wonder fill’d, we soon shall see
How wise, how strong His hand. 2 He keeps her now—securely keeps,
Whatever foe assails;
With vigilance that never sleeps,
With pow’r that never fails.

And ruleth all things well.

Confirm each feeble knee.

Confessing unto all we meet

And heav’n is now your home.’’246—247

And full escape provide.

The Son of God His blood hath shed,
The Father’s co-eternal Son
Had all our sins upon Him laid;
The Son of God for us hath died,
Our Lord, our Life was crucified,—
2 Was crucified for us in shame,
To bring us, rebels, back to God;
So we may glory in His name,
For we are cleansed by His blood:
Pardon and life flow’d from His side,
When He, the Lord, was crucified.
3 Then let us glory in the cross,
And make it here our constant them e;
All things for Christ account but dross,
And give up all our hearts to Him.
Of nothing speak or think beside,
The Lord, Who here was crucified.
1 L ike sheep we went astray
Far from the fold of God,
Each wand’ring in a diff’rent way,
But all the downward road.
2 How dreadful was the hour
When God our wand’rings laid,
And did at once His vengeance pour,
Upon the Shepherd’s head !
3 How glorious was the grace
When Jesus suffer’d th u s ;
His guiltless life the Shepherd pays,
To give that life to us !
4 His honour and His breath
Were taken both away;
Join’d with the wicked in His death,
And made as vile as they.
5 Gladly He bow’d His head
For us, the sons of men,
That we by Him, the woman’s seed,
Might conquer death and pain.255

That sinners endless life might gain.

And joyfully His mercy own,
And humbly now and evermore
Before His wounded feet fall down ;
Serve without dread, with rev’rence love
The Lord Whose boundless grace we prove.
2 The Lamb was slain! both day and night
The angelic choirs His praises sing ;
To Him enthron’d above all height,
They round the throne their anthems bring;
As saints on earth we join the song,
And praise Him tho’ with stamm’ring tongue.
3 Gladly our own poor works we leave,
For Him despise wealth, pleasure, fame,
To Him our souls and bodies give,
Whose love doth our affections claim;
Henceforth we own Him as our Lord,
Alone belov’d—alone ador’d.
4 Through Him alone we live, for He
Hath drowned our transgressions all
In love’s unfathomable sea:
0 love, unknown, unsearchable !
5
As ground, when parch’d with summer’s heat,
Gladly drinks in the welcome show’r,
So would we, list’ning at His feet,
Receive His words, and feel His pow’r ;
Let nothing in our hearts remain
But this great truth, “ The Lamb was slain! ”

Within Thy shelt’ring fold,
Move them from ev’ry harm away,
And in Thy safeguard hold;

In us the fruits of grace,
And we, in joys that never end,
Shall see Thee, face to face.256 257

And grant us such a rich increase
Of unction from on high ;
That spirit, soul, and body may,
Preserved free from stain,

As now we journey, day by day,
“ Himself has borne our sins away,
Our sins are all forgiven.”

For evermore to call Him m ine!
And see Him still before m e;
For ever on His face to gaze!
And meet His full assembled rays,
While all the Father He displays
To all the saints in glory!
3 Not all things else are half so dear
As His delightful presence here,
What must it be in heaven
4 But how will His celestial voice
Make each enraptur’d heart rejoice,
When we in glory hear H im !
When we no longer at the gate,
But in His blessed presence, wait,
When Jesus on His throne of state
Invites us to come near Him !

The things above to things below ?

The name and character we bear?
And where are seen those heav’nly fruits
That show we’re not what once we were?

Longs and watches, weeps and prays,
So the church must long for Thee.
4 Come, that we may see Thee nigh;
Then the sheep shall feed in peace,
Hush’d for ever trouble’s sigh,
Sin and sorrow’s triumph cease.
Diffusing fragrance round,
As show’rs that usher in the spring,
And cheer the thirsty ground;
4 So shall His gracious presence bless,
And give us joyful light;
That hallow’d morn will chase away
All sorrows of the night.
CCLXX.— 8s.
1 0 S aviour ! Whom absent we love;
Whom not having seen we adore,
Whose name is exalted above
All glory, dominion, and pow’r.271

2 When that happy morning begins,
When we in Thy glories shall shine,
Nor grieve any more by our sins
The bosom on which we recline; 3 The cross has prov’d their endless gain ;
With Jesus they’ll for ever reign ;
And seated on His throne, shall praise
The blessings of redeeming grace.
3 O then shall the mists be remov’d,
And round us Thy brightness be pour’d !
We shall meet Him, Whom absent we lov’d,
We shall see, Whom unseen we ador’d. 4 Hunger they ne’er shall feel again,
Nor burning thirst shall they sustain;
To wells of living water led,
By God the Lamb for ever fed.
4 And then never more shall the fears,
The trials, temptations, and woes,
Which darken this valley of tears,
Intrude on our blissful repose. 5 Jesus, the Saviour, is their theme ;
They sing the wonders of His nam e;
To Him ascribing pow’r and grace,
Dominion and eternal praise.
CCLXXI.— 8s.
1 B ehold the saints belov’d of God,
Who wash’d their robes in Jesu’s blood;
More spotless than the purest white,
They shine in uncreated light.
2 From tribulation great they came,
They bore the cross and scorn’d the shame;
But now in joy unceasing rest,
With God in glory fully blest.
6 “ Amen !” they cry to Him alone,
Once dead, now seated on His throne;
To Him be glory, and again
To Him be praise, “ Amen ! Amen 1”
C C L X X II.-8, 6.
1 How bright these glorious spirits shine,
Whence all their bright array!
How came they to the happy seats
Of everlasting day ?272
2 L o ! these are they from suff’rings great,
Who came to realms of light,
And in the blood of Christ have wash’d
Their robes, which shine so bright.
3 Now with triumphant palms they stand
Before the throne on high;
And serve the Lord they love, amidst
The glories of the sky.
4 His presence fills each heart with joy,
And gives them pow’r to sing;
While day, and night, the sacred courts
With glad hosannas ring.
5 Hunger and thirst are felt no more,
Nor sun with scorching ray;
God is their sun, whose cheering beams
Give them eternal day.
6 The Lamb, Who dwells amid the throne
Shall o’er them still preside,
Feed them with nourishment divine,
And all their footsteps guide.
7 Midst pastures green He’ll lead His flock,
Where living streams appear,
And God the Lord, from ev’ry eye
Shall wipe off ev’ry tear.

CCLXXIII.— 8, 6.
1 Now may the God of peace and love,
Who, from the silent grave,
Restor’d the Shepherd of the sheep,
Omnipotent to save,—
2 Through the rich merits of that blood
Which He on Calv’ry spilt,
To make the gracious work secure,
On which our hopes are built,—
3 Perfect our souls in ev’ry grace,
To do His blessed will,
And all that’s pleasing in His sight
Inspire us to fulfil.

We ev’ry blessing p ray ;
With glory let His name be crown’d
Through heav’n’s eternal day.

S aviour and Lord, our Priest and King,
Who didst for our transgressions die,
Bearing our grief, that Thou miight’st bring
Pardon and immortality;275

To bear Thy praises up on high,
Dominion, blessing, might, we ’ll sing
To Thee, throughout eternity;
Amen ! Amen ! Our God, Amen.
CCLXXV.—8s.
1 T he Lord is coming in the clouds,
Is coming with angelic crowds,
An universal shout shall rend
The air, and Jesus will descend.
2 How grand the pomp of His descent,
What glory waits on the event!
The glory that to heav’n belongs,
Is His, and His the angels’ songs.
3 Unlike to those who nothing see
Beyond the world, those men should be,
Who look for Jesus in the air,
And know that they shall meet Him there.
4 Their girded loins, and lamps of fire
Should tell what is their souls’ desire,
To see the object of their love,
And dwell with Him in heav’n above.

CCLXXYL—8, 8, 6.
1 J ehovah , Jesus! glorious Lord,
We seek Thy Spirit with the word,
For all Thy saints around:
We seek for each of Thine now here,
The seeing eye, the hearing ear,
To know the joyful sound!
2 Without a flowing stream of grace,
To see God’s glory in Thy face,
And manifest Thee, Lord;
Our- meetings here must barren prove
Not one can taste the father’s love,
Or savour of the word.
3 The Holy Ghost, in blessing thus,
Must take of Thine and shew to us,
Thine own and God’s im part;
And He no less the same must prove,
And shed abroad the Father’s love,
In each renewed heart;
4 Yet Lord! Thy grace we dare not bound:
Near to Thyself we ’ve always found
The Holy Ghost is ours:
Thy Person is the blessed clue
To all who would the Father view
And know the Spirit’s powers.277—278
CCLXXVII.— SECOND PART.
1 S hepherd of life ! do Thou behold
The little ones within the fold,
With special grace, this day;
That all God’s children giv’n to Thee,
May have their portion full and free,
And none go lean away.
2 That fully taught, we all may boast
In Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;
For this to us is giv’n ;
That each may say, in godly fear,
“ Rejoice, ye saints, the Lord is near,
He ’ll quickly come from heav’n.”
CCLXXVIII.—8s.
279
3 This union assures us of bliss,
Secur’d in the Head of all pow’rs ;
We’ve portion in all that is His,
And Jesus in all that is ours.
4 Hence the church, tho’ by nature so mean
(In itself it is nothing but sin),
In Jesus is perfectly clean,
And holy and righteous in Him.
CCLXXIX.—SECOND PART.
1 How wond’rous the glories that meet
In Jesus, and from His face shine!
His love is eternal and sweet,
’Tis human, ’tis also divine !
1 How precious that truth to the soul,
“ That Christ and His people are one
He life-giving Head to the whole,
They members, and bone of His bone. 2 His glory—not only God’s Son—
In manhood He had His full part,—
And the union of both joined in one,
Form the fountain of love in His heart.
2 An union so firm and so sure,
Will bear the severest review,
In Jesus the whole is secure,
And nothing its bands can undo. 3 Ye wash’d in the blood of the Lamb,
Remember, when sorrows press sore,
Your Jesus did once feel the same,
When conflicts and trials He bore.281
280
4 Your Jesus both knows and hath felt,
What marks all our sorrows and fears,
Since here in the flesh He once dwelt,
And offer’d strong crying and tears.
5 And we, as redeemed, well know,
This Jesus the same in His love;
The feet cannot suffer below,
And the Head be unconscious above!
Blessing and honour to obtain,
And everlasting love.
2
Hail! Hallelujah ! power and praise
To God in Christ be given!
May all who now this anthem raise
Renew the strain in heaven!
CCLXXXI.— 8, 6.
6 And all that He has, He will use,
For the Church ’mid her sorrows and woes,
While the truth of His God she pursues,
Nor aught of His conflict foregoes.
7 The merits and worth of His blood,
Have rais’d us from hell and from fear,
That we as the blest sons of God,
Might make His good pleasure our care
8 0 then may this union and love
Make us walk in the service of Heaven,
Mid’ obedience and suff’ring to prove
That we to the Lamb had been giv’n.
CCLXXX.—8, 6.

W orthy the Lamb for sinners slain
(Cry the redeem’d above),
1 J esus , Thou source of true delight,
Whom we unseen adore,
Unveil our souls to all Thy light,
That we may love Thee more,
2 Thy glory o’er creation shines ;
But in the sacred Word
We read in fairer, brighter lines,
The glories of our Lord.
3 ’Tis here, whene’er our comforts droop
And sins and sorrows rise,
Thy love with cheerful beams of hope
Each fainting heart supplies.
4 Jesus, our Lord, our Life, our Light,
0 come with blissful ray:
Break through the gloomy shades of night,
And bring the look’d for day.282
5
Then shall each soul with rapture trace
The wonders of Thy love ;
And the full glories of Thy face,
As known to those above.
283
4 Led by that, we brave the ocean;
Led by that, the storm defy;
Calm amidst tumultuous motion,
Knowing that our Lord is nigh:
Waves obey Him,
And the storms before Him fly.
CCLXXXII.— 8, 7.

W hy those fears? behold ’tis Jesus
Holds the helm, and guides the ship ;
Spread the sails, and catch the breezes
Sent to waft us through the deep,
To the regions
Where the mourners cease to weep.
I Could we stay where death is hovering ?
Could we rest on such a shore ?
No; the awful truth discovering,
We could linger there no m ore;
We forsake it,
Leaving all we lov’d before.
I Though the shore we hope to land on,
Only by report is known,
Yet we freely all abandon,
Led by that report alone,
And with Jesus,
Through the trackless deep move on.
5 Render’d safe by His protection,
We shall pass the wat’ry waste
Trusting to His wise direction,
We shall gain the port at last;
And with wonder,
Think on toils and dangers past.
6 0 what pleasures there await us !
There the tempests cease to roar:
There it is that those who hate us
Can molest our peace no more:
Trouble ceases
On that tranquil, happy shore.
CCLXXXIII.— 8, 8, 6.
1 To those who love Thee, gracious Lord,
How bright, how precious is the Word,
By God in mercy given,

A guide to all who, travelling here
Mid sin and darkness, death and fear,
Are pressing on to heaven.
2
0 gracious Saviour,
God of love,
Aid Thine own Spirit from above,
And fill us with desire
To read, to mark, to learn Thy will,
And with Thy truth our spirits fill,
And touch our hearts with fire.
3 And till in glory Thou dost come
To take Thy waiting people home,
With those at Thy right hand;
E’en till that great and dreadful day,
When heaven and earth shall pass away,
May we in service stand!
CCLXXXIV.— 8, 6.

See, see Him as He is ;

Your happiness is His.
4 0 think not of this world of woe,
Though subject I till to grief;
But seek your portion there to know,
For this will give relief.
5 Aye trust, for ever trust in God,
For ev’ry promise giv’n ;
And dwell with Him through Jesu’s blood,
Within the veil of heav’n.
CCLXXXV.— 8s.

To Jesus raise your song,
Your joys can never, never fail,
For you to Him belong.

From guilt, and every care;

Whose depth unfathom’d no man knows,
I see from far Thy beauteous light,
And gladly seek in it repose;
That thus my heart from earth set free,
May find its whole delight in Thee!286
2
0 crucify this self, that I
No more, but Christ in me may live;
And bid each vile affection die,
Nor let one hateful lust survive;
In all things nothing may I see,
Nothing desire, or seek, but Thee.
287
And when the storms of life shall cease,
And Thou to earth shalt come at length,
Then to Thy glory be my Guide,
And show me Him Who for me died.

No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
Then bend my wayward heart to Thee,
And reign without a rival there :
Thine, wholly Thine, alone I’d live;
Myself to Thee entirely give.
2 O Lord, how cheering is Thy way!
How blest! how gracious in mine eyes!
Care, anguish, sorrow, pass away,
And fear before Thy presence flies
O Jesus, nothing may I see,
Nothing desire, or seek but Thee!
3 ’Mid conflict be Thy love my peace!
In weakness be Thy love my strength 1

Attend the trumpet’s sound:
Stand to your arms, the foe is nigh,
And pow’rs of hell are round.
2 Consider Christ, your Head—
Your Captain’s footsteps see;
Follow the Saviour, and be led
To certain victory.
3 All pow’r to Him is giv’n—
He ever reigns the same;
Salvation, happiness, and heav’n,
Are yours in Jesu’s name.
4 Our Captain leads us o n ;
He beckons from the skies;
He reaches out the starry crown,
And bids us take the prize.288

Our arms and hearts prepare;
And firmly in the battle stand,
To wage a glorious war.

The soul, which still on Thee is staid,
Is kept in perfect peace.

By faith on Jesu’s breast
In deepest woe exults to find
A sweet eternal rest.
3 Jesus, to Whom we fly,
Does all our wishes fill,
In vain the creature-streams are dry,
We have a Fountain still.

We find them all in One!
And peace, and joy, that never ends,
And heaven—in Christ alone !

And stands before our God;
And sprinkled now is all the throne,
With His atoning blood.
2 No fiery vengeance now,
No burning wrath comes down,
Where Justice calls for sinners’ blood,
The Saviour shews His own.
3 Then may our joyful tongues
Our Maker’s praises sing;
Jesus, the Priest, receives our songs,
And bears them to the King.
4 We bow before His face,
And sound His glories high;
“ Hosanna to the God of grace,
That brought the guilty nigh.”

Let praise your tongues employ;
Floods, clap your hands; exult, ve plains,
And shout, ye hills, with joy!

Nor thorns o’erspread the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow,
Far as the curse is found.

Thy praise shall sound from shore to shore,
’Till suns shall rise and set no more.
CCXCIII.— 6, 6, 8, 6.
1 W ho trust unto the Lamb,
Whom we in heaven see,
Are cleans’d by blood from guilt and shame,
From condemnation free.
2 In counsels deep of old,
The sons of God they were ;
And all the lambs of Jesu’s fold
Were blest in Jesus there.
3 This union ne’er shall break,
Though earth’s strong columns bow;
The strong, the tempted, and the weak,
Are one in Jesus now.294

4 Then, saints, erect your heads,
You’re form’d in Christ anew;
And tho’ thro’ earth destruction spreads,
No danger reaches you. 4 While yet we sojourn here below,
Pollutions still our hearts o’erflow;
A fali’n, abject, sentenc’d race,
We deeply need a hiding-place.
5 Should storms of trouble rise,
Or deadly foes assail;
Your anchor safe on Jesus lies,
Your hope’s within the vail. 5 But pure, immortal, sinless, free,
We, through the Lamb, at length shall b e ;
Shall meet the Father face to face,
And need no more a hiding-place.
CCXCIV.— 8s.

Retune thy strings for Jesus’ sake;
We sing the Saviour of our race,
The Lamb, our shield and hiding-place.
2 ’Tis He, the Lamb, to Him we fly,
W’hile the dread tempest passes b y ;
God sees His Well-beloved’s face,
And spares us in our hiding-place.
3 Thus, while we dwell in this blest scene,
The Lamb is our unfailing screen;
To Him, though guilty, still we run,
And God still spares us for His Son.
CCXCV.— 1 0 ,1 0 ,1 1 , 11.

Guide,
’Tis ours to obey; ’tis His to provide:
Tho’ cisterns be broken, and creatures all fail,
The Word He hath spoken shall surely prevail.
2 His love in time past forbids us to think
He’ll leave us at last in trouble to sink:
The Lamb in His glory is ever in view,
The pledge and the proof He will help us quite
through.
3 And since all we meet must work for our
good,
The bitter is sweet, the med’cine is food;296—297

That did on Him devolve.

Salvation is secure:
The merits of His life and death,
Eternally endure.

High on Thy glorious throne;
For Jesus sits beside Thee now,
Because Thy will is done.

Like Mary, at the Master’s feet!
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, my only bliss,
My joy, my heav’n on earth be this,
To hear the Bridegroom’s voice.

Recline my wearied soul upon
The dear Redeemer’s breast;
From care and sin, and sorrow free,
Give me, 0 Lord, to find in Thee,
My everlasting rest!298—299

Dispel the sloth and clouds of n ig h t!

On which to place our hopes of heaven,

Through scorn and sore temptation,

Each breath we draw, each pulse that beats,
Each organ formed by skill divine,
Each precious sense aloud repeats—

Unfading, undefiled,
Where God unveils His smiling face
On Jesus His beloved Child—

And hearken to their ceaseless song
Of Jesu’s dying love:307

From the rising of the sun,
Unto where his course is done,
Out of ev’ry land they came,
All who loved the Saviour’s name.
2 Behold the robes so dazzling white,
In which array’d they stand;
Like victors from a glorious fight,
Palms waving in their hand:
Out of sorrow, toil, and shame,
Gladly borne for Jesus’ nam e;
In His blood their robes made white,
In His strength they won the fight.
3 Behold they strike their golden lyres,
How sweet, how loud the song !
All heaven’s vast angelic choirs,
In united strain prolong.
“ Glory be to Him, Who gave
His dear Son our souls to save;
Glory to the Lamb, Whose blood
Reconciled us all to God!”
4 Soon we shall join that countless throng,
Safe in the heav’nly fold,
And sing that new, that happy song,
And wear our crowns of gold.
Let us glory in the cross,
Count all else but worthless dross,
And amidst reproach and shame,
Praise our Jesu’s precious name.

Began our grateful hearts to move,
And gazing on the wond’rous cross,
We saw all else as worthless dross.

We meet Him Whom our souls adore;
When sorrows, conflicts, fears, shall cease,
And all our trials end in peace.

And cast our longing eyes on Thee;
On Thee our light, our life, our love,
Our all below, our heaven above.308

Eternal day without a night!
Lord, when shall we its dawning see,
And spend it all in praising Thee ? 4 Ascended now, in glory bright,
Still one with us Thou a r t ;
Nor life, nor death, nor depth, nor height,
Thy saints and Thee can part.
6 Come, Saviour, come! 0 quickly come!
Take us Thy waiting people home;
We long to stand around Thy throne,
To love and serve Thee, Lord, alone. 5 O teach us, Lord, to know and own
This wondrous mystery,
That Thou with us art truly one,
And we are one with Thee.

Thou didst from heav’n come down,
Our mortal flesh and blood partake,
In all our misery one.
3 Our sins, our guilt, in love divine,
Confess’d and borne by Thee;
The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,
To set Thy members free.

When, seated on Thy throne,
Thou shalt to wond’ring worlds display:
That Thou with us art one !

The chains that once bound us, by Jesus are

We ’re strangers on earth, and our home is

2 Our path is most rugged, and dang’rous too,
A wide trackless waste our journey lies
through;311

Bring the palm, and strew the way,
And with singing greet Him.
Jesus is the victor’s name,
Jesus, Lord of glory!
Fly, ye heralds, spread His fame,
Tell the joyful story.
But the Pillar of Cloud that shews us our way,
Is our sure light by night, and shades us by
day.
3 Our Shepherd is still our Guardian and Guide,
Before us He goes to help and provide;
We drink of the streams from the Rock that
was riv’n,
Our bread is the Manna that came down from
heav’n.
4 Mid mightiest foes—most feeble are we—
Yet trembling in ev’ry conflict they flee;
The Lord is our Banner— the battle is H is-
The weakest of saints more than conqueror is.
5 Soon shall we enter our own promis’d land,
Before His bright throne in glory shall stand:
Our song then for ever and ever shall be,
“ All glory and blessing, Lord Jesus, to Thee!”

He alone shall wear it.

Our toil and sorrow cease;

And all be joy and peace.

In all His footsteps tread;
And, in a world of evil, still
To grieve Him only dread.312

3 May we His name confess
’Midst suffering, shame, and loss;
Stand forth His faithful witnesses,
And glory in the Cross.
But since to us in Jesu’s face
There shines the Glory of Thy Grace,
We know that we are Thine.

Our loins well girded b e;
In works of faith and love abound,

“ Enter Thy Master's joy.”

That Jesus Christ is made our own,
The Gift of Grace divine.

Nor persecution nor distress,
Shall separate from Christ the Lord.

And those who on His word rely,
Shall find this truth for ever sure.

Whose glory never shone more bright

By angels own’d, admir’d, ador’d,

And crowns of glory wreath His head!

Could offer that which justice claim’d.

Thou from cruel chains hast freed us,
Thou hast laid the tyrant low:

Cheer us all our journey through.

Ready to obstruct our way,
Suddenly their hearts shall tremble,
Thou wilt strike them with dismay i
And Thy people,
Led by Thee, shall win the day.
With a price Thy love has bought us,
(Saviour, what a love is Thine!)
Hitherto Thy pow’r has brought us,
(Pow’r and love in Thee combine):
Lord of glory,
Ever on Thy household shine.

Scatter ev’ry hostile band;
Be our guide and our protector,
Till on Canaan’s shores we land :
Where in glory
Soon we hope with Thee to stand.
Through a desert waste and cheerless,
Though our destin’d journey lie,
Render’d by Thy presence fearless,
We may ev’ry foe defy:
Nought shall move us,
While we see the Saviour nigh.
When we halt, (no track discov’ring),
Fearful lest we go astray,
O’er our path Thy pillar hov’ring,
Fire by night, and cloud by day,

Manna shall our camp surround;

Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,
Fresh from God’s exhaustless tides.

God Himself shall mark thy way,
Secret blessings, richly flowing,
Lead to everlasting day.

Feeds thee with the mighty’s meat,
Price of Egypt’s hard extortion,
Egypt’s food no more to eat.

There unfold His hidden treasures,
There His love’s exhaustless deep.

' What the God that thou hast found,
Patient, gracious, powerful, holy,
All His grace shall there abound.

E’en thy wants and woes shall bring
Suited grace from high descending,

Love divine thy foot shall bring,
There with shouts of triumph swelling
Zion’s songs in rest to sing:

Stranger thou in courts above,

Greets thee with a well-known love.

See His glory fully blaze:324

Aught that more of God displays ;

Love and justice shine for ever;
And, without a veil between,

And rejoice in His great name.

And hast our peace secured.

To God’s right hand in heaven,

Though from all else we part.

And glory in Thy cross;

And for our life gave up His own.

And dying, conquer’d death for us,
That we, like Him, might rise.

How cold the heart, how faint the tongue!
But O a bright eternal day
Will bring a more exalted song,
Resounding in immortal strains,
Jesus, the King of glory, reigns!
1 J esus , Who vanquish’d all our foes,
Who came to save, Who reigns to bless,
From Thee our ev’ry comfort flows,
Life, liberty, and joy, and peace.
Resound, ye saints, the joyful strain,
Let Him, the King of glory, reign.
2 0 Thou art worthy, gracious Lord,
Of universal, endless praise,
With ev’ry pow’r to be ador’d
That men or angels e’er can raise.
And heav’n and earth shall blend their strains,
Jesus, the King of glory, reigns.
3 But earth and heav’n can ne’er proclaim
The boundless glories of their King;
Yet do our hearts adore His name,
The name whence all our blessings spring.

Of all that seek the rest above,
Beneath Thy shadow we abide,
The cloud of Thy protecting love;
Our strength Thy grace, our rule Thy word,
Our end, the glory of our Lord.
2 By Thine unerring Spirit led,
We shall not in the desert stray,
Or light for our direction need,
Or lose, though dark and drear, our way,
But kept from danger, and from fear,
Since Thine Almighty love is near.342—343
CCCXLII.— 8s.
1 S trangers and pilgrims here below,
This earth we own not as our place,,
But hasten through its toil and woe,
Impatient to behold Thy face;
On to our heav’nly country move,
Our everlasting home above.
2 We ’ve no continuing city here,
But seek a city out of sight,
Thither our upward course we steer,.
As dwellers in its courts of light;
Jerusalem, the saints’ abode,
Whose builder is the living God.
3 Patient, th’ appointed race we run,
This weary world we cast behind,
From strength to strength we travel on,
Our holy dwelling-place to find;
Our labour this, our only aim,
To reach the new Jerusalem.

That on Christ alone she rests.

All who here His burden bear,
In the end will prove victorious,
And eternal glories share.
3 Christ, the ever blessed Saviour,
Bore for us reproach and shame;
Now as conqu’ror lives for ever,
And we conquer in His name.

Living still a life of faith;
Let us sing glad songs of praises,
Though it be ’mid shame and death,

1 0 I srael , to thy tents repair,
Why so secure on hostile ground ?
The King commands thee to beware,
For many foes thy camp surround.
2 The trumpet sounds a martial strain,
Then Israel gird thee for the fight;
Arise, the combat to maintain,
And put thine enemies to flight.345
3 Thou should’st not sleep as others do,
Awake, be vigilant, be brave;
The coward and the sluggard too,
Must wear the fetters of the slave.
4 A nobler lot is cast for thee,
Fair Canaan’s spread before thine eyes:
With such a hope, shall Israel flee ?
Or yield through weariness the prize?
5 No, though a careless world repose,
And slumber on through life’s short day,
God’s Israel to the conflict goes,
And bears the glorious prize away.
CCCXLV.— 8,6.

His arm outstretch’d in love !
And while our bodies wander here,
Our hearts are fix’d above.

1 A bove the clouds a city stands,
Of living stones not made with hands,
Where God the Saviour ’ll reign:
Tis built for sinners bought with blood,
Redeem’d and sanctified to God,
And cleans’d from every stain.
2 The cities of this world must fall,
However solid, they must all
The common ruin share;
But yonder city still appears
Unchangeable through endless years,
For God Himself is there,
3 Happy the saints who shall abide
Within those walls, and there reside
For ever with the K ing;
We hope that we shall soon be there,
Its joys and blessedness to share,
The Saviour’s praise to sing.347—348
CCCXLVII.— 8s.
1 A h ! who upon earth can conceive
The bliss that in heaven Saints share?
Or who this dark world would not leave,
And earnestly long to be there ?
There Christ is the light and the sun,
His glories unhinder’dly shine ;
His presence their spirits have won.
And rest in the glory divine.
2 ’Tis good, at His word, to be here,
Yet better it is to be gone,
And there in His presence appear,
And rest as He rests on the throne;
Yet a h ! it will gladden our eyes,
When Him we behold on the cloud,
And echo the joys of the skies,
And shout to the trumpet of God.
349
2 When sin no more obstructs our sight,
And flesh and sense deceive no more,
When we shall see the Prince of light,
And all His works of grace explore:
What heights and depths of love divine,
Will there through endless ages shine!
3 And God has fix’d the happy day,
When the last tear shall dim our eyes,
When He will wipe these tears away,
And fill our hearts with glad surprise;
To hear His voice, and see His face,
And feel His infinite embrace.
4 This is the joy we seek to know.
For this with patience we would wait,
Till call’d from earth and all below,
We mount to our celestial seat ;
To wave our palms, and wear the crown,
And at His feet to cast them down.

W hat will it be to dwell above,
And with the Lord of glory reign,
Since the sweet earnest of His love,
So brightens all this dreary plain:

Unbounded bliss shall rise,
And realms of infinite delight

There man shall ne’er complain;
But all who reach that peaceful home,
With Jesus there shall reign.

For ever bright and fair;
For sin, the source of mortal woe,
Can never enter there.

Our hearts with ardent love,
Till wings of faith and strong desire
Bear ev’ry thought above.

Unto the Lamb Who once was slain.

Hosannas to th ’ eternal King.

But there shall be in endless rest,
Where dangers ne’er shall threat again ;
For Jesus reigns, and they shall share
With Him His fullest glory there.

But gladness fill the happy plain:
Free from all sin, and free from fear,
None shall e’er sigh or shed a tear.

Their joyful notes, and sing this strain;

They stand before Jehovah’s throne ;
The only song in which blest place
Is—“ Thou art worthy 1 Thou alone !”

His name, His glorious name we sing,
The rightful Heir of heav’n.
5 " For Thou wast slain, and in Thy blood
These robes were wash’d so spotless pure
Thou mad’st us kings and priests to God—
For ever let Thy praise endure.” 2 He once was found with men,
A man of sorrows H e ;
He bore His people’s sentence then,
He bore it on the tree.
6 While thus the ransom’d myriads shout,
“ Amen,” the holy angels cry;
“ Amen, Amen,” resounds throughout
The boundless regions of the sky. 3 He suffer’d in their stead,
He sav’d His people th u s ;
The curse that fell upon His head,
Was due, by right, to us.
7 Let us with joy adopt the strain
We hope to sing for ever there;
“ Worthy’s the Lamb for sinners slain,
Worthy alone the crown to wear!” 4 ’Twas love that brought Him down,
The purest, strongest love ;
He bore the cross, He won the crown,
And now He reigns above.
8 W ithout one thought that’s good to plead,
O
what could shield us from despair
But this, though we are vile indeed,
The Lord our Righteousness is there. 5 The praise of saints be given
To Him Who worthy is ;
He died on earth—He lives in heav’n,
Eternal praise be His.353—354
CCCLIII.—8, 6.
1 T hough now we bear the chilly blast,
Though cradled now in woe,
The church shall ev’ry storm outlast,
Outlive each cruel foe.
2 Then shall we sing of battles won,
Of garments roll’d in blood,
Of myriads slain by David’s Son,
The conq’ring Lamb of God;
3 Of blood that loos’d the captive’s chain,
Redeem’d his life, and seal’d
The record of a deathless name
That lives in heav’n reveal’d.
355
3 Brightly it beam’d on men forlorn,
When Christ, the holy child was born;
And brighter still in splendour shone,
When Jesus, dying, cried, “ ’Tis done 1”
4 The work complete when He arose,
Bursting the snares of all His foes,
When captive led captivity,
And took for us His seat on high.
5 Till we around Him then shall throng,
This mercy shall be still our song;
And ev’ry scheme shall God confound
Of all who strive its course to bound!

When God announc’d the early news,
“ The woman’s seed Thy head shall bruise.
1 A wake our souls! awake our tongues;
The subject is divine:
The Saviour’s love demands our songs ;
Let all His people join.
2 This Saviour is the Mighty God,
Who rests in heav’n above ;
Reveal’d in flesh, He shed His blood,
And thus declar’d God’s love.356 357
3 Jesus, Thy love exceeds our thought;
But this at least we see,
The soul that knows Thy pow’r is taught
To value nought but Thee. CCCLVII.— 8, 6.

W h a t’s seen demands our praise;
W ithout it, Lord, we still had been
Engag’d in folly’s ways.

This the Spirit’s voice declares !
Death, nor hell, nor sin shall sever,
Jesus from the chosen heirs. 4 Jesus, Who left the throne on high,
Left the bright realms of bliss,
And came to earth to bleed and die:
Was ever love like this ?
3 Saints above, in His communion,
Rest from conflict with their H ead;
While we sing the blessed union,
Though in thorny paths we tread. 5 Dear Lord, we gladly, humbly pay

Through the Mediator’s blood:
One with God, with Jesus one,
Glory is in them begun.

None so oft mislead our feet,
None betray us into sin
Like the foes that dwell within:
Yet let nothing spoil your peace,
Christ will also conquer these;
And the joyful news will come,

Combin’d with power that hell employs,
With safety it defies:
Erected for God’s own name’s sake,
Though earth with deep convulsions shake,
Majestic it shall rise.

And hail its crowning stone;

And let the off’rings of our tongues

For all the blessings of the light;
Keep me, 0 keep me, King of kings,
Under Thine own Almighty wings. 2 Through all the dangers of the day
Thyself for us hast car’d ;
And still to drive our wants away,
Thy mercy stands prepar’d.
2 Forgive me, Lord, for Thy dear Son,
The ills that I this day have done;
That with the world, myself, and Thee,
I, ere I sleep, at peace may be. 3 Perpetual blessings from above
Encompass us around;
But ah ! how few returns of love
Hath our Redeemer found.
3 0 may my soul on Thee repose,
And with sweet sleep mine eyelids close;
Sleep, that may me more active make,
To serve my God when I awake. 4 What have we done for Him Who died
To save our sinful souls ?
Alas ! our sins are multiplied,
Fast as each minute rolls.

And now to heaven for man alone

How bitter, who can tell ?
’Twas thus He paid our debt, and thus
He saved our souls from hell.
3 We hail the day, the week’s first day,
The day the Saviour rose:
The Lord, He bore our sins away ;
From this our comfort flows.
4 From this there flows a rich supply
Of all we can require;
Tis pardon, peace, and holy joy—
What more can we desire ?
5 What more, but that we may sustain
Untir’d the holy strife ;
And then, with all the victors, gain
A crown, the crown of life?

Remember’d by His friends;
Upon His rising, all agree,
Their hope of heaven depends.

His people’s hope is vain ;
He then would have no power to save,
Nor should they live again.

But now is Jesus ris’n indeed,
And He “ the first-fruits” is ;
The first-fruits of the ransom’d seed,
Of those He claims as His.

Come before the God of heaven:

Fill us, Lord, with holy gladness:
All the worldling’s mirth is madness;
But Thy people should rejoice.
3 Of Thy love for ever tasting,
Theirs are pleasures everlasting;
Theirs a treasure never wasting,
Which nor moth nor rust destroys.

Joy and gladness well become us:

Breaking bread in peace and love,

Jesus took His place above:
Heaven was fill’d with rapture then ;
All was wonder, joy, and love.

Him Who rose again and lives;

Keeps us till the final day;

From sin and death to set us free.

Take, receive it, as your food;
But, as oft as this ye do,
Keep your m artyr’d Lord in view.

Overwhelm’d in deep disgrace:
Plung’d in horror’s dreadful flood,
Bearing all the wrath of God.

For we are vile and base;
Christ is our all, of Christ we sing,
And wait to see His face.
3 As beggars poor, and blind, and mean,
We rest on Christ alone:
Thanks to the Lamb that once was slain—
The Lamb that did atone.
4 Our sins are His (O bless His name!)
His righteousness is our’s ;
He saves from Satan, wrath, and sin,
And all their frightful powers.
5 Then let us each, with heart and tongue,
Sing, “ Worthy is the Lamb !”
To Him alone the praise belongs,
And we ’ll adore His name.

Nothing for our souls sufficed:

Pardon through the blood of Christ.

While on Christ our souls are fed,
Here the world may see our union,
One the body—one the bread.
Now we seek for nought beside,
Richly all our need supplied.

Points to the blood which Thou hast shed.

But to do our Master’s will;
Thus to Jesu’s self resembling,
God Himself shall cheer us still. 2 And while we meet together thus,
We shew that we are one in Thee,

Thy death, 0 Lord, has set us free.

’Tis in Thy name, that now we meet,
And know Thou’rt with us, gracious Lord.

We the wine together sup,
We have joy, both sure and stable,
One the blessing—one the cup.

One with Christ, and one with God;
One we are, and nought can sever
Us who are redeem’d with blood.
6 By our sins His blood was spilled.
Pardon hence through love Divine!
And, through Him the law fulfilled,
In His righteousness we shine.
7 Till He comes we still are thinking ^
That “ we wait for Him to come,”
And (with us the new wine drinking)
Take us to His royal home.

When Thou wilt take Thy people home,

Of the judgment unto blood;

Of Thy soul in wrath’s deep flood.

Only fully known to God.

To behold Thee on Thy throne,
